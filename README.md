## Safeheap
Safeheap is a C/C++ POSIX compliant library with the focus on memory security implementations. The library utilizes four categories of protection:

- Segmentation
- Cryptography
- Randomization
- Erasure

### Segmentation
Upon a dynamic allocation of memory, the user may specify they want to segment the memory variable. Meaning dividing it into separate chunks spread across the memory heap.

## Cryptography
The user may also specify they want to encrypt the allocated memory. This is done internally when the user writes/reads the memory. The encryption algorithms used are symmetrical meaning there is only one key involved for encrypting and decrypting said memory. The key is stored and handled internally by the library and not made accessible to the user. The key may be stored either in memory in the protected memory table (PMT) or in a TPM module if available.

## Randomization
Various randomization techniques may be used if specified by user upon allocation. Randomization aims to 'randomize' various signatures that may reveal secret information, such as side-channel information (e.g. power analysis, accoustic analysis, cache monitoring, etc.) or
